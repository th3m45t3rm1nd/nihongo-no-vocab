Depending on the context, this verb can also mean to miss something (like the target during archery practice), to remove something, or to exclude something. This is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You disconnect something, like a plug, or remove something, like your dog's leash. It's worth mentioning that most verbs ending in \u3059 are transitive, so you'll start seeing this pattern as you learn more! "

Whereas \u66ff\u308f\u308b is used when things or situations switch places or are replaced with something new, like when talking about generations changing or a new governmental cabinet taking over. This verb is intransitive, meaning it doesn't take a direct object. You'll sometimes see it with the particle \u3092, though, because the \u3092 is showing a \"path\" rather than a direct object in this case. For example, \u5e2d\u3092\u66ff\u308f\u308b (to switch seats) indicates your location is moving from one seat to another.

The word \u201coxygenium\u201d in Greek/Latin literally means \u201cacid maker\u201d. Long ago chemists thought oxygen was a defining characteristic of acids, later they found out there are also acids without oxygen like hydrochloric/muriatic/salt acid and the defining characteristic actually is hydrogen.
